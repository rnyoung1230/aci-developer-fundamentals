# Task 1: Password checker
'''
Many websites prompt users to create a password to protect their account. The companies hosting websites
often have different requirements to ensure that user passwords include a significant degree of complexity.
When you enter a new password, it can be checked for complexity and assigned a strength score.

For this task, you will write a module that includes functions that check a string for complexity, and
return a password strength score to the user. Then, you will write a script that imports the module.
When it runs, it should ask the user for a password and print the strength score, along with some context
to explain if the password is strong enough.
